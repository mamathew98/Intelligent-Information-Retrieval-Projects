 Expand German Die Weber date March 2011 The Weavers lang de Die Weber Silesian German lang sli De Waber is a play written by the German playwright Gerhart Hauptmann in 1892. Plot summary Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions the play has no true central character providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting. Production history The Weavers was staged on Broadway in 1915 1916. The Weavers at the Internet Broadway Database Criticism Barrett H. Clark s comments as one of Gerhart Hauptmann s experiments in dramatic form The Weavers is highly significant. Instead of a hero he has created a mob this mob is therefore the protagonist—or chief character—and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. It is the weavers as a class that are ever before us and the unity of the play is in them and in them alone they are only parts of a larger picture which will take shape as the story advances and are not intended to be taken as important individuals.
